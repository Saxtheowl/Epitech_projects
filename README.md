<h1>Epitech Projects with AI</h1>

<p>
  This repository is my attempt to complete most of the Epitech school projects by leveraging modern AI tools.
  The goal is not just to replicate the work, but to explore how advanced AI systems can assist, accelerate,
  and reshape the way we approach complex programming challenges.
