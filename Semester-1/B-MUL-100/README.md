# B1 - C Graphical Programming  (B-MUL-100)

> Crédits disponibles: 5 crédits
<br>

## Description du module
The graphical programming consists in creating images/animations and scenes management using algorithms and graphical resources.

This unit aims to initiate you into this domain and, in a medium run, to prepare yourself to the main issues of the MyRPG, which is the main project of this unit at the end of the year. 
The two important axis of such a project are:
1 - Graphical special effects generation, 2D/3D rendering, collision management, entity management, etc. being part of the mathematical component.
2 - Gameplay, animations with sprites, virtual world coherence, lifespan of the game, etc. everything enhancing the "game" aspect.

For the first unit, the projects are:
- MyHunter: Game with a fixed camera, in which the player can shoot in some moving elements.
- MyRadar: Collision detection between a large number of flying planes within a 2D space.

Throughout the year, you will use the CSFML, a multimedia librairie developped in C.
