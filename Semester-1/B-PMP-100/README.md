> Crédits disponibles: 1 crédit
<br>

## Description du module
During your semester you will be confronted to multiple projects. For each of them you will, consciously or not, be confronted to project management.
    - How do I conduct my project?
    - How do I organize myself?
    - When in a group, how do we organize the work for each members?
    - In a group, how to deal with conflicts
    - And so on

This unit's purpose is to acknowledge this fact and give you a credit for it.

How will be evaluated?
    => In most technical units you will have at least 1 review. Each review evaluates, among other things, your (and your group's) organization. The validation of this unit depends on these evaluations.
