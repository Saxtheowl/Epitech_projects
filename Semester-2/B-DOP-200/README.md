## Description du module
This module is the first of a series of 3 modules, the DevOps track, in which you will learn the ins and outs of the DevOps ecosystem, with a great tour of the technologies used in this modern popular software engineering movement.

This module will be followed next year by the B4 - DevOps module, where you will discover two more technologies, and will be concluded the year after by the B5 - Advanced DevOps module, where you will discover a final technology and conclude with an important end project, blending all the previous projects and notions together in one final, epic, challenge.

In this module, you will be introduced to two notions and their associated technologies, with the following projects:
- Popeye (containerization with Docker)
- Chocolatine (automation with GitHub Actions)

Everything that you will see in this module will be useful for your other projects, and will help you be more efficient and successful with them.
