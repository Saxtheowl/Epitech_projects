## Description du module
Each project includes two workshops. Personalized follow-ups are organized for students who encounter difficulties.

CONDITIONS FOR VALIDATING THE MODULE:

You must complete at least 2 projects during the semester to validate this professional writing module. If you only complete one project, you will automatically fail this module regardless of the result obtained.

The grade will be awarded based on the results of the assessment of skills demonstrated in the projects. These will be evaluated at mandatory scheduled assessment sessions.

In addition, your commitment to completing the projects, your organization in managing the work throughout the module, and your ability to take action to progress will be taken into account in the assessment and award of the grade.

The projects in this module consist of producing written documents that meet the basic criteria for any professional document. Each project is preceded by courses and tutorials on writing techniques. Personalized follow-ups are also organized for students who encounter difficulties.

In addition, self-study resources are made available to students to help them solve specific difficulties (agreement of past participles, not confusing "to," "a," and "as," etc.). These resources are freely available on the e-learning site (Semester 0 / Professional writing self-study).
