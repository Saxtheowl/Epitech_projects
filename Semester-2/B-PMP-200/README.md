# B2 - Introduction to Project Management  (B-PMP-200)

> Crédits disponibles: 2 crédits
<br>

## Description du module
During your semester you will be confronted to multiple projects. For each of them you will, consciously or not, be confronted to project management.
    - How do I conduct my project?
    - How do I organize myself?
    - When in a group, how do we organize the work for each members?
    - In a group, how to deal with conflicts
    - And so on

This unit's purpose is to acknowledge this fact and give you credits for it.

How will be evaluated?
    => In most technical units you will have at least 1 review. Each review evaluates, among other things, your (and your group's) organization and testing policy. The validation of this unit depends on these evaluations.

The credits in this unit are progressives and can be earned like this:
        - 1 credit is dedicated to you and your group organization
        - 1 credit is dedicated to the testing policies you implemented in your projects
The grade will depend on both these parameters from every review and keynote you made.
