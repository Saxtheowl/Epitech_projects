> Crédits disponibles: 3 crédits
<br>

## Description du module
This unit is made up of one single project, which consists of simulating an autonomous car. 

It is also an excuse to have you briefly discover the world of Artificial Intelligence: what is it about? what can we do with it?  

A few things (in no particular order):
        - The unit will end with a local tournament to see whose car is the fastest!
        - There are a lot of possible techniques and optimizations in order to go faster. Come have fun!  I

About the unit structure.  


The bootstrap only covers the practical aspect of moving the car, not on how to make it complete all tracks. The conferences will not be directly based on the project's subject. 

The main key words are in the project description. It's up to you to know how to use a search engine to its full capacity and your skills in order to understand, assimilate, apply and optimize the solutions you will find. 

## Compétences à acquérir
• Overview of "Artificial Intelligence" domain 
• Introduction to research in a state-space 
• Awareness of the data structure problems and algorithmic complexity 
• Methodical approach to measuring a program's performance
